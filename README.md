# DynamicRNN

The example for Recurrent Neural Network of Variable Sequence Length 


1. Generate training/testing data (Binary Classification)
  - Featrue 
    - binary data which of length is from 3 to 20 (ex) 0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1 (length 4) )
  - Label 
    - classification whether the number of 1s are more than 7 ( ex) 1 if the number of 1s 9 )

2. training and testing RNN model
  - In default configuration, the accurarcy of model is more than 95%
